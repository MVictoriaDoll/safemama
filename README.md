Web app to check product safety during pregnancy

SafeMama is a simple web application that helps pregnant women verify whether a product is safe to eat, drink or use during pregnancy. 
Users can search for a product and see its safety level: safe, not safe or use with caution. Each product includes a brief explanation.
The idea is to provide clear and useful information, especially at a time when many everyday products can generate doubts. The app starts with a small list of products, and if there is time, categories (such as food or medicines) and other functionalities could be added later.
