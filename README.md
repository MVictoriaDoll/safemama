Web app to check product safety during pregnancy

## Description

SafeMama is a simple web application that helps pregnant women verify whether a product is safe to eat, drink, or use during pregnancy.  
Users can search for a product and see its safety level: **safe**, **unsafe**, or **caution**.  
Each product includes a short explanation and a link to a reliable source.

The goal is to provide clear, useful informationâ€”especially in moments when everyday products may cause doubts.  
The app starts with a small database of 10 products. If there's time, categories (like food, medicine, cosmetics) and other features could be added later.
